Global Terrorism Data Analysis - Project 2 Report
1. Which countries experience the highest number of terrorist attacks?
The data shows that countries like Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Nigeria have experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents. This suggests that geopolitical instability, armed conflict, and weak governance in these regions may contribute to frequent attacks.
2. What are the most common types of terrorist attacks?
Bombings and armed assaults are the most frequent forms of terrorism globally. These attack types are often used because they can cause mass casualties or significant disruption with relatively simple logistics.
3. Is terrorism increasing or decreasing over the years?
Terrorist attacks saw a sharp increase from the early 2000s, peaking around 2014, and then showing a gradual decline in subsequent years. This trend could reflect global counterterrorism efforts and the rise and fall of major terrorist organizations like ISIS.
4. Which terrorist organizations are the most active?
Groups such as the Taliban, Islamic State (ISIL), Boko Haram, and Al-Shabaab are among the most active. These organizations often operate in regions with prolonged conflicts and aim to achieve political or religious objectives through violence.
5. Are there any seasonal trends in terrorist attacks?
A modest increase in attacks can be observed in the middle of the year, particularly from May to July. However, the data does not show strong or consistent seasonal variation across all years or regions.
6. What terrorist group dominates Nigeria most?
In Nigeria, Boko Haram is the most dominant terrorist organization. It has been responsible for a large proportion of attacks in the country, especially in the northeastern region.
7. What is the greatest target in (6) above?
Boko Haram most frequently targets private citizens and property, followed by attacks on police and educational institutions. This reflects their strategy of spreading fear and undermining public trust in the government and security forces.
